## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find issues in the code, bugs or malfunctions, contact me on Discord (Guanciottaman#7217). Report it and I will tell you if it's meant to happen or
not. If not, be free to fix the code yourself and make a pull request (or just send me the code, in both ways I'll put credits); I will still fix bugs if you
aren't interested in contributing.
